			Introduction
		</h3>

		<p>ME3Explorer is a fan-built toolset used to mod Mass Effect 3. With a combination of over 50 unique tools, a large part of the game may be edited: 
		Meshes, textures and audio can be edited/extracted/created, objects and levels can be edited/created/moved to a certain degree.
		Almost every aspect of cutscene conversations can be altered from dialogue to camerawork, to adding new matinee tracks. 
		A wide variety of story changes can be made including adding new codices, emails, war assets, achievements, and even entire new systems to the galaxy map.
		<br>
		ME3Explorer also contains a small limted number of tools for Mass Effect and Mass Effect 2.</p>

		<p>The toolset isn't just meant for mod creators, users may also use ME3Explorer to apply .mod and .tpf files available for download on various sites. 
		ME3Explorer is also necessary for the installation of new "DLC mods" to ensure the game reads the new DLC files properly.</p>

			BioWare's Stance on Modding
		</h3>

		<p>BioWare's stance on modding Mass Effect is dependent upon campaign type. No action will be taken against players who mod single-player content, 
		but they do so at their own risk. However, modding multi-player can be a bannable offense if the mod gives the player an unfair advantage. 
		Players who choose to mod these files must do so with extreme caution..</p>

			Contributing
		</h3>

		<p>As with the community, the tool is ever evolving, and always in need of more developers. If you're interested in helping out, 
		please head over to the forums and say hello! All of the source-code is available here on github, 
		but can be a bit intimidating if you're just starting out, so get in contact with an active developer to get an introduction.
